# CO2_emit_data

work in progress,

analysing the emissiosn data 

data source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/global-fossil-co2-emissions-by-country-2002-2022

For first_EDA.ipynb one can install all requirements with pip and requirements.txt

For interactive_map_plots.py geopandas has to be instsalled with conda (GeopandasDataFrame.explore() only worked this way for me). The packages pandas, mapclassify, and folium are also needed.

To view the interactive maps can be viewed here:
